# pics_organizer
Simple python script to help manage pictures on PC and upload on Dropbox.
Everytime new picture are uploaded a notification is sent to a desired email address.

I use Task Scheduler to run the script periodically on Windows.

A batch script could be used to trigger it but task scheduler has elevated privilleges so no additional configs for that.
